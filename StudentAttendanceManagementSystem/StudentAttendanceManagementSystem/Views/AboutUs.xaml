                    The Hari Sri Vidya Nidhi Trust was registered as a Society under the Travancore — Cochin Literary, Scientific and <LineBreak></LineBreak>Charitable Societies Registration Act on 27th July, 1983. The nucleus of this institution was the Hari Sri Nursery<LineBreak></LineBreak> and Primary School founded and run by Mrs.Nalini Chandran since 1st September, 1978, when the auspicious ritual ,<LineBreak></LineBreak> of lighting the sacred lamp was performed by Smt. Kannambra Ammukutty Nethiar, the maternal grandmother <LineBreak></LineBreak>of the institution FOUNDER, Mrs. Nalini Chandran.
                  The school grew as an extension to the tharavad Ashtami.<LineBreak></LineBreak>Eventually, Mrs.Nalini Chandran  volunteered to empower the parents by including them in the Trust of the Hari <LineBreak></LineBreak>Sri Primary School. Thus she chose members of the First Executive committee.Balakrishnan Iyer insisted on Mrs. <LineBreak></LineBreak>Nalini Chandran being the only life member of the Hari Sri Vidya Nidhi Trust. With time the middle school had<LineBreak></LineBreak> to function out of rented places in Palliyil Lane, old Surakshita School and the place next to Printwell.Thus was the<LineBreak></LineBreak> journey of Hari Sri Nursery to Hari Sri Vidya Nidhi.
